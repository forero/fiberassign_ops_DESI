\section{Introduction}


The \textbf{Survey Operations} plan includes both Survey Validation
and the 5-year survey.  Following DocDB 3308-v4, Survey Operations
lists four major areas:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Survey management.
    \item Survey validation.
    \item Tracking and reporting
    \item Nightwatch and Exposure Time Calculator
\end{itemize}

Fiberassignment is explicitly included under item \textbf{Survey Management}
with the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run the fiberassignment code to provide assignments of fibers to
  input targets, stars (calibration and guide/focus arrays) and sky
  locations. 

\item Track the number of exposures for each LRG target for
  reaching a number pre-determined by each galaxyâ€™s magnitude. 

\item Re-observe the high-redshift QSO targets if they are
  determined to be a high-confidence target from previous observations.

\item Ensure the reproducibility of fiber assignment for the
  selection functions of the Large Scale Structure catalogs.

\item Implement modifications necessary for failures of individual
  fibers or other constraints imposed by changes to the instrument
  during operations. 
\end{enumerate}


During \textbf{Survey Validation} (SV0, March 2020) tasks 1 and 5 were 
already performed (Sarah and Ted.)

There is work in progress with the Lya QSO working group to explore
and implement changes that address task 3 (Jaime).

First attempts to address 4 has been already peformedn on simulations
(1\% survey) and SV0 data (Ashley).  
 


\section*{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the expected cadence to update the merged target list with
  spectroscopic information and run fiberassign? (As per DESI-3308 one
  week cadence is expecte from the Lyman-Alpha Decision Lead.)
\item How are we going to track where the fibers really were on the
  sky (we need GFA + FVC data to do that, who is responsible fort that
  product?)
\end{itemize}
